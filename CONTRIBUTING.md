### Want to Make This Project Even Better?
PRs are welcomed! If you have some suggestions on how this project can be improved then there are a couple of things you can do.

#### Open an issue
You can open an issue if you have some suggestions or if you are looking for some feedback on improvements you want to add. 
These are great if you want to confirm suggestions before you start any work. A comment will be added, letting you know if 
suggestions are accepted. From there you can start your work.

Issues will remain open until the PR is merged or if the suggestion is rejected.

#### Open a PR
You can go ahead and create a PR if you have no questions (_look at you, all confident_ :smirk:). 

Please include the following info
in your pull request:

- What is this PR trying to solve or improve?
- What did you do?
- Link to open issue (if applicable)

Please include information about any new tests, libraries, etc. And because this is a repo for E2E tests, it would look bad 
if those tests didn't pass. 

**For any changes, make sure tests pass!** If they don't pass then the PR can't be approved.
